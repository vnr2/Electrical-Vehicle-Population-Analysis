# Electrical-Vehicle-Population-Analysis

**Project Objective**

This project's objective is to perform an in-depth analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) population data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to EV growth and adoption. The project uses Power BI, Tableau, and Python to provide interactive dashboards and data-driven visualizations that help stakeholders understand regional distributions, vehicle types, manufacturer statistics, and policy impacts on EV usage.

KPI's 

1) **Total Vehicles**: Covers the overall landscape of Electric Vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs to evaluate the market's size and growth
2) **Average Electric** Range: Overall Electric Range of all Electric vehicles in the dataset
3) **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles**: Covers Total Electric Vehicles that fall under BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) and Percentage of BEVs relative to the Total number of electric vehicles
4) **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles**: Covers Total Electric Vehicles that fall under PHEV ( Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) and Percentage of PHEVs relative to the Total number of Electric Vehicles.
